        <h1> Frittata- Fancy Leftovers</h1>
        <p> a frittata is more of a method than a recipe. sauteed veggies meet cheese and creamy eggs for the perfect breakfast casserole </p>
        <p> wonderful to serve a crowd if you've got friends over for brunch</p>

        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>mixing bowl</li>
            <li>whisk</li>
            <li>casserole dish (13x9in for this recipe, for other sizes adjust cooking time)</li>
            <li>oven</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Egg Mixture</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 eggs</li>
            <li>2 tbsp milk or cream</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fillings</h3>
        <p> frittata fillings can be pretty much anything you can think of (or that you need to use up from your fridge)</p>
        <h4> some of my favorite combinations:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 red potato cut in 1-in chunks and steamed in the microwave+wilted kale or spinach+smoked sausage</li>
            <li>sauteed onions and bell pepper+sauteed chunks of ham+cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>sauteed onions and cherry tomatoes+microwave steamed asparagus+soft goat cheese</li>
            <li>thawed frozen broccoli+cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>caramelized onions+sweet potato or butternut squash chunks+diced bacon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare casserole dish- spray with cooking spray or grease with butter</li>
            <li>Prepare fillings- chop what needs chopping, saute what needs sauteeing. to save time, I tend to dump my fillings (except cheese) straight into the casserole dish when finished.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees farenheit</li>
            <li>Crack eggs into mixing bowl, add salt and let sit for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Add milk to eggs and whisk vigorously until fluffy</li>
            <li>Pour egg mixture into casserole dish over fillings. If using cheese, add about half and mix gently</li>
            <li>Sprinkle top with the rest of the cheese, add generous amount of black pepper</li>
            <li>Bake between 14-18 minutes- start checking at 14 if eggs reach desired consistency. Frittatas with more soft/liquidy ingredients (goat cheese, caramelized onions, tomatoes) will stay softer</li>
            <li>Let frittata cool and set for about 5 minutes, then slice to serve warm</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>makes about 6 servings</em></p>
