        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>about 8 slices (or half a loaf) of slightly stale bread, torn into small chunks (sweet bread like brioche/challah/raisin bread works best)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 cups milk or cream</li>
            <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>pinch (1/8 tsp) salt</li>
            <li>optional: 1/4 tsp any spices or flavorings (cinnamon+nutmeg+clove is traditional, but anise, cocoa powder, instant coffee, and whisky are all good additions. Just not together. Pick one)</li>
            <li>optional: 1/2 cup mix-ins. Dried fruits, nuts, apple chunks, fresh berries, and chocolate chunks are all delicious</li>
         <h2>Directions</h2>

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees farenheit</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan over low heat, warm milk, butter, vanilla, sugar, flavorings, and salt until butter melts, then remove from heat and let cool</li>

            <li>Add mix ins</li>
            <li>Add eggs to cooled milk and whisk until combined, then pour into dish over bread. If you've got time, let bread and eggs soak for ~15min before baking</li>
            <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until custard has set and bread has started to brown. Serve warm or at room temperature.
